FeedReader is a C++ library designed to retrieve and parse web feeds such as RSS, ATOM and RDF.
Features:

FeedReader was designed to scale: it is fast, thread-safe, extensible and platform-independent.

In FeedReader, all feeds are transformed via XSL to a uniform schema before being parsed. 
This means that in order to extend FeedReader to support a new feed format, all that is needed is a new XSL file. 
The library comes with XSL files supporting for the following feed formats:

    * RSS 1.0
    * RSS 2.0
    * ATOM 0.3
    * ATOM 1.0
    * RDF 

An iterator interface is provided to the feed elements parsed.

Using the library is simple and sample client code is located in the examples directory.
Dependencies:

The FeedReader library is dependent on, and was tested with the following libraries/versions:

    * Boost 1.36 (was also tested with 1.33_1)
    * libcurl 7.18.1
    * Xerces 2.8.0
    * Xalan 1.10.1
    * Zlib 1.23 (required by CURL)
